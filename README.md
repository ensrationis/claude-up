# claude-up

Setup Claude Code for any repository in one command. Role-based profiles for team use.

## Install

```bash
git clone <repo-url> ~/claude-up
ln -s ~/claude-up/claude-up.sh ~/.local/bin/claude-up

# Install global safety hooks (once per machine)
claude-up --global
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH.

## Quick start: new project

```bash
cd ~/sources/my-new-project
git init
claude-up --profile firmware .
```

What happens:
1. `CLAUDE.md` appears in the project root — open it and fill in the `TODO` entries
2. `.claude/` directory is created with settings, skills, agents
3. `.gitignore` is updated to protect local files
4. Project memory is initialized at `~/.claude/projects/...`

Run `claude` — everything works immediately. Try `/flash`, `/review`, `/commit`.

## Applying to an existing project

If Claude Code is already running and there's no `CLAUDE.md` yet:

```bash
# From a separate terminal (not inside Claude Code):
claude-up --profile firmware /path/to/project

# If CLAUDE.md or settings already exist and you want to replace them:
claude-up --force --profile firmware /path/to/project
```

Without `--force`, existing files are skipped:

```
  SKIP: CLAUDE.md already exists
  SKIP: .claude/settings.json already exists
  OK: skills added: flash size-report test-native     # new skills are still added
  OK: agents added: firmware-reviewer critic observer  # new agents are still added
```

This is safe to run multiple times — skills and agents merge per-item, nothing is lost.

### Layering profiles

You can apply several profiles to the same project. Each one adds its own skills and agents:

```bash
claude-up --profile firmware .       # +3 skills, +1 reviewer
claude-up --profile research .       # +4 skills, +1 reviewer
# Result: 7 profile skills + 2 universal agents + 2 reviewers
```

## Updating active Claude sessions

After running `claude-up` on a project where Claude is already running:

### Changes that take effect immediately

- **CLAUDE.md** — Claude re-reads it on every message. Edit and save — next message uses the new rules.
- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) — new slash commands are available right away. Type `/` to see them.
- **Agents** (`.claude/agents/`) — available immediately for spawning.

### Changes that require session restart

- **settings.json** — permissions and hooks are loaded at session start. Exit Claude (`/exit` or Ctrl+C) and start a new session.

### Without restart (session running for hours, don't want to lose context)

```bash
# 1. From a separate terminal:
claude-up --profile firmware /path/to/project
$EDITOR /path/to/project/CLAUDE.md   # fill in TODOs
```

Then in the active Claude session, type:

```
прочитай CLAUDE.md и следуй инструкциям из него
```

Claude will re-read CLAUDE.md and pick up the rules, style, workflow. Skills and agents are also available immediately — type `/` to see them. The only thing missing is hooks and permissions from `settings.json` — those load at session start.

### With restart (clean slate)

```bash
# 1. From a separate terminal:
claude-up --profile firmware /path/to/project
$EDITOR /path/to/project/CLAUDE.md   # fill in TODOs

# 2. In the active Claude session:
/exit

# 3. Start fresh — everything loads:
cd /path/to/project && claude
```

### Context compaction

When a long session runs out of context, Claude compacts the conversation. The SessionStart hook (from `settings.json`) automatically injects `git log -10` and `git diff --stat` so Claude retains project history after compaction.

## What it creates

```
your-repo/
├── CLAUDE.md                        # Project description (fill in TODOs)
├── .claude/
│   ├── settings.json                # Permissions, hooks (shared via git)
│   ├── settings.local.json          # Personal settings (gitignored)
│   ├── skills/                      # Slash commands (/commit, /review, ...)
│   └── agents/                      # critic, observer + profile reviewer
└── .gitignore                       # Protects settings.local.json
```

Plus project memory at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/memory/MEMORY.md`.

## Profiles

| Profile | Domain | Skills | Reviewer |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| `firmware` | PlatformIO, ESP-IDF, Arduino | `/flash`, `/test-native`, `/size-report` | firmware-reviewer |
| `hardware-cad` | OpenSCAD, KiCad, build123d | `/render-stl`, `/gen-bom`, `/drc` | cad-reviewer |
| `cloud-devops` | Docker, SSH, Ansible | `/check-nodes`, `/deploy`, `/logs` | security-reviewer |
| `frontend` | Vue/React, Tailwind, web3 | `/dev`, `/lint-fix`, `/build` | frontend-reviewer |
| `docs` | weasyprint, matplotlib, PDF | `/gen-pdf`, `/gen-all`, `/preview` | numbers-verifier |
| `research` | Python, LaTeX, Monte Carlo | `/run-model`, `/build-paper`, `/cite`, `/figure` | paper-reviewer |

Without `--profile`, you get 5 universal skills: `/make-pr`, `/review`, `/commit`, `/explore`, `/changelog`.

```bash
claude-up --list    # show available profiles
```

## Agents

Every project gets three agents:

| Agent | Purpose | When it runs |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **@critic** | Reviews changes for bugs, security, performance | After every non-trivial task (automatic via Workflow) |
| **@observer** | Checks compliance with CLAUDE.md rules | After every non-trivial task (automatic via Workflow) |
| **profile reviewer** | Deep domain review (embedded, CAD, security...) | On demand via `/review` or agent delegation |

The Workflow section in CLAUDE.md instructs Claude to spawn @critic and @observer in background after completing implementation tasks. Trivial tasks (typos, questions) are excluded.

All agents use model: sonnet, read-only tools, and report without modifying files.

## CLAUDE.md structure

Template with sections based on [Anthropic's best practices](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory#claudemd). Fill in `TODO` placeholders:

| Section | Purpose | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Architecture** | Key directories and their roles | High — orients Claude without scanning |
| **Commands** | Exact build, test, lint, deploy commands | Critical — Claude cannot guess these |
| **Testing** | How to verify changes, run single tests | Critical — prevents broken commits |
| **Code Style** | Only deviations from language defaults | Medium — Claude knows standard conventions |
| **Gotchas** | Non-obvious behaviors, known pitfalls | High — impossible to infer from code |
| **Rules** | Hard constraints with alternatives | High — "NEVER X — use Y instead" |
| **Workflow** | When to run @critic and @observer | Pre-filled — no TODO needed |

Profiles add domain-specific sections (Hardware for firmware, Design Guide for docs, etc.).

Tips:
- Keep under 60-150 lines. Move deep knowledge to `.claude/rules/*.md` or skills.
- Commands and Gotchas have the highest ROI — fill these first.
- Rules work better with positive alternatives: "NEVER hardcode credentials — use config header" vs just "NEVER hardcode credentials".

## settings.json

Each profile includes:

- **Permissions**: auto-allow domain tools (`pio *`, `docker *`, `yarn *`, etc.)
- **PostToolUse hook**: auto-format on save (clang-format, prettier, or ruff depending on profile)
- **SessionStart hook**: after context compaction, injects git log and diff so Claude retains history

## Global safety hooks

```bash
claude-up --global
```

Installs `~/.claude/settings.json` with safety hooks that protect **all** projects on the machine:

| Hook | What it blocks |
|------|---------------|
| PreToolUse / Bash | `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, `chmod -R 777`, `dd` |
| PreToolUse / Edit\|Write | `.env`, `.pem`, `.key`, `credentials`, `secrets`, `.git/` |
| Notification | Desktop alerts when Claude needs permission or is idle |

The source file is `global/settings.json` in this repo. Edit it, commit, `claude-up --global` again to update.

If `~/.claude/settings.json` already exists, the script asks before overwriting and creates a timestamped backup.

Requires `jq` and `notify-send` (Linux). On macOS replace `notify-send` with `osascript -e 'display notification ...'` in `global/settings.json`.

## Creating a custom profile

```bash
mkdir -p profiles/my-profile/{skills,agents}
# Copy and edit from an existing profile:
cp profiles/firmware/CLAUDE.md profiles/my-profile/CLAUDE.md
cp profiles/firmware/settings.json profiles/my-profile/settings.json
# Add skills and agents as needed
# Use: claude-up --profile my-profile /path/to/repo
```
